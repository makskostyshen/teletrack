# Teletrack

## Overview 

This application enables you to track [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org/) messages in real time: forward new messages to other chats if they satisfy criteria.

It is built on fully functional Telegram client library - [TdLib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib).

## Installation

You need to have [Java 17](https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-set-path-in-java) and [Apache Maven](https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-install-maven) correctly installed.

Implementation of TdLib is OS dependent. As Windows x64 user, I've already built library version for Windows x64. So if you have this OS - process of installation will be simplified.

### Windows x64

Execute commands:

```
cd <repository location>
git clone https://github.com/makskostyshen/teletrack.git
mvn install:install-file -Dfile="teletrack/windows64/tdlib.jar" -DgroupId=com.teletrack -Dar
tifactId=telegram-library -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar
```

### Other OS

1. Build TdLib following [instructions](https://tdlib.github.io/td/build.html?language=Java).

2. Clone this repository. Copy ``/tdlib`` folder from built library project to root of created repository.

3. Build .jar file from generated classes and create a Maven artifact. Execute:
   
    ```
    cd <repository location>
    jar cf tdlib.jar -C tdlib/bin .
    mvn install:install-file -Dfile="tdlib.jar" -DgroupId=com.teletrack -Dar
    tifactId=telegram-library -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar
    ```

## Configuration

1. Create your Telegram Api: https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id
2. Add configurations to application.properties file:
   - ``app.telegram.client.apiId`` - id of created API
   - ``app.telegram.client.apiHash`` - hash of created API
   - ``app.messages.forward.group.config-file`` - file name of message forward groups configuration. default: messageTypes.json
   - ``app.messages.forward.group.timezone-id`` - [timezone id](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZoneId.html). Default: Europe/Kyiv
3. Fill the [message forward groups](#message-forward-group) file configuration

## Description

### Message forward group

Message forward group is a base unit of this application, which is responsible for forwarding messages to other chats.
It is configured by user. If telegram message is classified as part of message forward group - forwarding logic will be applied to it.
Message can belong to multiple forward groups.

Message forward group contains:
 - Name - serves as a unique identifier
 - Source Chats Ids - all chats, which can contain units of message forward group
 - Target Chats Ids - chats to forward units of forward message group
 - Criterion - necessary and sufficient rule, applied to message content and used to determine if this message belongs to the forward group

Criterion is a nested structure of combination of predefined type criteria.

Types of criteria:
- `containsText` - is satisfied if message content has given text
- `and` - is satisfied if all nested criteria are satisfied
- `or` - is satisfied if at least one nested criterion is satisfied
- `not` - is satisfied if nested criterion is not satisfied


  Example in JSON:
```
  {
    "name": "test-group",
    "targetChatsIds": [-1002084999999],
    "sourceChatsIds": [-1001181888888, -1014111777777],
    "criterion": {
      "or": [
        {
          "containsText": "text1"
        },
        {
          "containsText": "text2"
        },
        {
          "and": [
            {
              "containsText": "text3"
            },
            {
              "not": {
                "containsText": "text4"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```
This message forward group looks for messages in chats with ids `-1001181888888`,
`-1014111777777` and sends them to chat with id `-1002084999999` if they contain `text1` or `text2` or contain 
`text3`, but do not contain `text4`.


There are two ways of configuring message forward groups:
- Before application start - in JSON file, which location is specified in property ``app.messages.forward.group.config-file`` 
- After application start - using [REST endpoints](#rest-endpoints)

### Handling updates

Application handles new message updates from telegram server.
So any message received or sent in real time will be handled.

Also, client's state in relation to messages in specific chat is saved. Unhandled messages,
received during the period of time when client was not active,
will be handled after the start-up of this client.
Reading messages on other devices of the account does not affect this.


## REST endpoints

All endpoints operate in-memory data.
So changes, that have been made using endpoints or data that have been obtained using endpoints will be lost after stopping the application.

### Auth

- `GET: /auth/state` - get current authentication state.
Possible authentication states: `READY`, `WAIT_PHONE_NUMBER`, `WAIT_PHONE_CODE`
Application handles updates only in ready state. Other states indicates invoking appropriate actions

- `POST: /auth/phone` - send phone number. Body:
  ```
    {
      "phoneNumber": "38097xxxxxxx"
    }
    ```
- `POST: /auth/code` - send code, received by phone number. Body:
  ```
    {
      "code": "Super secret code"
    }
    ```
### Chats

- `GET: /chats` - get chats. Chat is being saved, if update with this chat is received


### Message forward groups
- `GET: /messages/forward/groups` - get message forward groups
- `POST: /messages/forward/groups` - add message forward group. Body:
  ```
  {
    "name": "work-search-group-5",
    "targetChatsIds": [-1002084684686],
    "sourceChatsIds": [-1002084684682],
    "criterion": {
      "containsText": "text1"
    }
  }
    ```

- `DELETE: /messages/forward/groups{forward-group-name}` - delete message forward group by name
